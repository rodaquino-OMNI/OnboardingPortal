# Comprehensive Test Strategy - Onboarding Portal

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Onboarding Portal application, covering all aspects of quality assurance from unit tests to end-to-end validation.

## Current Infrastructure Assessment

### Frontend Testing
- **Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright configured for multiple browsers
- **Coverage**: Currently minimal, needs expansion
- **Status**: ✅ Configuration complete, tests needed

### Backend Testing
- **Framework**: PHPUnit with Laravel testing utilities
- **Database**: SQLite in-memory for tests
- **Coverage**: Some existing tests, needs comprehensive suite
- **Status**: ⚠️ Some PHP configuration issues detected

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: ✅ All services running
- **Database**: ✅ 16 users in database
- **APIs**: ✅ Health endpoints responding
- **CI/CD**: ❌ Not configured

## Test Pyramid Strategy

```
         /\
        /E2E\      <- Critical user journeys (5-10 tests)
       /------\
      /Integr. \   <- API + Database integration (20-30 tests)
     /----------\
    /   Unit     \ <- Component + Service logic (100+ tests)
   /--------------\
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (Target: 85% coverage)
- React components with mocking
- Business logic functions
- Utility functions
- Form validation
- State management

### 2. Integration Tests (Target: 20-30 tests)
- API endpoint testing
- Database operations
- Authentication flows
- File upload/processing
- Third-party integrations

### 3. End-to-End Tests (Target: 10-15 tests)
- Complete user registration flow
- Health questionnaire completion
- Document upload process
- Telemedicine scheduling
- Admin dashboard workflows

### 4. Performance Tests
- API response times
- Page load performance
- Database query optimization
- Memory usage validation
- Concurrent user handling

### 5. Security Tests
- Authentication bypass attempts
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF token validation
- Data privacy compliance

### 6. Accessibility Tests
- WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast validation
- Mobile responsiveness

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% for critical paths
- **Mutation Testing**: 70% mutation score
- **Performance**: API responses < 200ms (95th percentile)
- **Security**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Test Requirements
- All tests must be deterministic and fast
- Integration tests must use test database
- E2E tests must run in isolated environments
- All tests must include proper cleanup
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Test Data Strategy

### Test User Accounts
```javascript
// Standard test users with different roles
const testUsers = {
  regular: { email: 'user@test.com', password: 'Test123!' },
  admin: { email: 'admin@test.com', password: 'Admin123!' },
  incomplete: { email: 'incomplete@test.com', password: 'Test123!' }
}
```

### Test Data Factories
- User factory with various states
- Health questionnaire with different risk levels
- Document upload scenarios
- Appointment scheduling scenarios

## Execution Strategy

### Local Development
1. Unit tests run on file changes
2. Integration tests run on commit
3. E2E tests run before push
4. Performance tests weekly

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Commit**: Unit + Lint + Type check
2. **PR**: Full test suite + Security scan
3. **Merge**: E2E + Performance tests
4. **Deploy**: Smoke tests + Health checks

## Tools and Technologies

### Frontend Testing Stack
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertions
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **MSW**: API mocking
- **Playwright**: E2E testing
- **Jest-Axe**: Accessibility testing

### Backend Testing Stack
- **PHPUnit**: Unit and integration tests
- **Pest**: Alternative testing framework (optional)
- **Laravel Factories**: Test data generation
- **SQLite**: In-memory test database
- **Telescope**: Debug and profiling

### Performance and Security
- **Lighthouse**: Performance auditing
- **k6**: Load testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security scanning
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Authentication System**: Critical security component
2. **Health Data Processing**: HIPAA/LGPD compliance required
3. **File Upload**: Security and performance concerns
4. **Payment Processing**: If applicable
5. **Admin Functions**: Privilege escalation risks

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Form Validation**: Data integrity
2. **Email Notifications**: Delivery reliability
3. **Third-party Integrations**: Service dependencies
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: User experience

### Low Risk Areas
1. **Static Content**: Documentation pages
2. **Basic UI Components**: Standard patterns
3. **Logging**: Non-functional monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- Test execution time < 5 minutes full suite
- Test flakiness < 1% failure rate
- Code coverage maintained > 80%
- Security vulnerabilities = 0 critical
- Performance regression alerts

### Business Metrics
