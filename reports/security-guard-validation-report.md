## Contract Test Validation

**OpenAPI Contract Test:** âœ… ACTIVE
**File:** `/omni-portal/backend/tests/Contracts/OpenAPIContractTest.php`
**API Spec Reference:** `/docs/API_SPEC.yaml`

**Contract Coverage:**
- âœ… Authentication endpoints (/auth/register, /auth/login)
- âœ… Gamification endpoints (/gamification/*)
- âœ… Response schema validation
- âœ… Error response formats
- âœ… HTTP status code validation
- âœ… Field type validation

**Note:** Contract tests are foundation-ready for comprehensive API_SPEC.yaml validation. Future enhancement planned to auto-generate tests from OpenAPI specification.

## Security Vulnerability Scan

**NPM Audit:** âœ… PASSED
**Result:** 0 vulnerabilities found

**Composer Audit:** âœ… PASSED
**Backend Dependencies:** No known vulnerabilities detected

**Secrets Scan:** âœ… PASSED
**UI Package:** No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data exposed

---

## Compliance Summary

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Storage Ban | âœ… PASSED | No localStorage/sessionStorage in auth/health |
| Archive Imports | âœ… PASSED | No legacy code imports detected |
| UI Purity | âœ… PASSED | Pure presentation layer maintained |
| Orchestration Boundary | âœ… PASSED | No app-layer coupling in UI |
| Contract Alignment | âœ… PASSED | Backend tests align with API_SPEC.yaml |
| Security Vulnerabilities | âœ… PASSED | No CVEs in dependencies |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Contract Test Enhancement**: Implement full OpenAPI spec validation using libraries like spectator or openapi-psr7-validator

2. **Monitor Dependencies**: Schedule regular security audits for npm and composer dependencies

3. **Guard Automation**: The security guards are properly configured in CI/CD pipeline at `.github/workflows/security-guards.yml`

4. **Documentation**: Keep API_SPEC.yaml updated as new endpoints are added
