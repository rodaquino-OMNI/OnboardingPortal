  - Development stage with debugging tools

- **Frontend Dockerfile** (`omni-portal/frontend/Dockerfile`)
  - Multi-stage build for optimized bundle size
  - Static file serving optimization
  - Security hardening
  - Performance optimizations

### Docker Compose Configurations
- **CI Environment** (`docker-compose.ci.yml`)
  - Optimized for testing environments
  - Parallel test execution
  - Security scanning integration
  - Performance testing setup

- **Production Environment** (Referenced in docker-compose.prod.yml)
  - Blue-Green deployment support
  - Load balancing configuration
  - Health check endpoints
  - Monitoring integration

## üìã Required Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Container Registry
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN  # Automatically provided by GitHub
```

### Security Scanning
```bash
SNYK_TOKEN              # Snyk API token
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN       # SemGrep API token (optional)
```

### Deployment
```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK           # Slack notifications
SECURITY_SLACK_WEBHOOK  # Security alerts
EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS     # Email notification addresses
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN   # Lighthouse CI token (optional)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions

### Running CI Pipeline
The CI pipeline automatically runs on:
- Push to `main`, `develop`, or `feature/*` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

### Manual Deployment
Use the deployment script for manual deployments:

```bash
# Deploy to staging
.github/scripts/deploy.sh staging

# Deploy specific version to production
.github/scripts/deploy.sh production -v v1.2.3

# Rollback production deployment
.github/scripts/deploy.sh production --rollback
```

### Security Scanning
Security scans run automatically:
- **Daily**: Comprehensive security scan at 2 AM UTC
- **On Push**: Basic security checks on every commit
- **On PR**: Security analysis for code changes

### Manual Security Scan
Trigger manual security scan:
```bash
gh workflow run security-scan.yml
```

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

### Code Coverage
- Backend: PHPUnit coverage reports
- Frontend: Jest coverage reports
- Combined coverage uploaded to Codecov

### Performance Metrics
- Lighthouse performance scores
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Backend response time monitoring
- Database query performance

### Security Metrics
- Vulnerability detection and tracking
- Dependency security status
- Container security posture
- Web application security score
