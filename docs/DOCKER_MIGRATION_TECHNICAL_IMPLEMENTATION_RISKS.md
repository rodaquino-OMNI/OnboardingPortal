# Docker Migration - Technical Implementation Deep-Dive Risk Analysis

## Laravel-Specific Container Risks

### 1. Artisan Command Execution in Containers

**Risk**: Artisan commands fail in containerized environment
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Probability**: 85%
- **Technical Details**:
  ```bash
  # These commands will likely fail:
  php artisan storage:link    # Symlink creation in read-only filesystem
  php artisan config:cache    # Cache directory permissions issues
  php artisan queue:work      # Process management in containers
  php artisan schedule:run    # Cron-like functionality doesn't work
  php artisan migrate:fresh   # Database connection timing issues
  ```

- **Specific Failures**:
  - `storage:link` fails when container filesystem is read-only
  - Cache directory `/var/www/bootstrap/cache` permission denied
  - Queue workers can't write to log files
  - Scheduled tasks don't execute without proper process management
  - Database migrations timeout waiting for MySQL container

**Mitigation**:
```dockerfile
# In Dockerfile, create writable directories
RUN mkdir -p /var/www/storage/logs \
    /var/www/storage/framework/cache \
    /var/www/storage/framework/sessions \
    /var/www/storage/framework/views \
    /var/www/bootstrap/cache && \
    chown -R laravel:laravel /var/www && \
    chmod -R 775 /var/www/storage /var/www/bootstrap/cache
```

### 2. Laravel Queue System Breakdown

**Risk**: Background job processing complete failure
- **Severity**: CRITICAL

  ```php
  // Current filesystem config will break
  'local' => [
      'driver' => 'local',
      'root' => storage_path('app'), // Path changes in container
      'throw' => false,
  ],
  
  'public' => [
      'driver' => 'local',
      'root' => storage_path('app/public'), // Symlink broken
      'url' => env('APP_URL').'/storage', // Wrong URL in container
      'visibility' => 'public',
  ],
  ```

- **Specific Issues**:
  - Document uploads stored to `/var/www/storage/app/documents/` become inaccessible
  - Public disk URL points to wrong container endpoint
