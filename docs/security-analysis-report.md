## üö® Critical Issues (CVSS Score 9.0+)

### 1. CORS Wildcard Origin in CorsMiddleware.php
**File:** `/app/Http/Middleware/CorsMiddleware.php:27`  
**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)  
**Severity:** Critical

```php
$response->headers->set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
```

**Issue:** The CORS middleware sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` which allows any origin to make requests, potentially enabling CSRF attacks and data theft.

**Impact:** 
- Cross-origin attacks from malicious websites
- Potential for credentials theft
- CSRF vulnerabilities despite CORS configuration

**Recommendation:** Use environment-specific origins:
```php
$allowedOrigins = config('cors.allowed_origins', ['http://localhost:3000']);
$origin = $request->header('Origin');
if (in_array($origin, $allowedOrigins)) {
    $response->headers->set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', $origin);
}
```

### 2. Hardcoded Cookie Security Settings
**File:** `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/AuthController.php:116`  
**CVSS Score:** 9.0 (Critical)  
**Severity:** Critical

```php
false, // Not secure for localhost development
```

**Issue:** Cookies are hardcoded as non-secure in production environments, allowing transmission over HTTP.

**Impact:**
- Session hijacking via HTTP interception
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Credential exposure

**Recommendation:** Use environment-based configuration:
```php
config('session.secure', app()->environment('production'))
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Issues (CVSS Score 7.0-8.9)

### 3. Potential XSS in Device Name Field
**File:** `/app/Http/Middleware/ApiSecurityMiddleware.php:86`  
**CVSS Score:** 7.8 (High)  
**Severity:** High

The middleware explicitly allows XSS patterns in the `device_name` field for "testing/sanitization" purposes.

**Impact:** Stored XSS vulnerability if device names are displayed without proper encoding.

**Recommendation:** Remove the exception or implement strict output encoding.

### 4. SQL Injection Bypass Potential
**File:** `/app/Http/Middleware/SqlInjectionProtection.php`  
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)  
**Severity:** High

The SQL injection middleware has optimization that could miss complex injection patterns due to caching and early returns.

**Impact:** Sophisticated SQL injection attacks may bypass detection.

**Recommendation:** Implement additional validation at the ORM level.

### 5. User Model hasRole Method Missing
**File:** `/app/Models/User.php:231`  
**CVSS Score:** 7.2 (High)  
**Severity:** High

```php
if ($this->hasRole(['admin', 'super-admin', 'manager', 'hr', 'moderator'])) {
```

The User model calls `hasRole()` method but the `HasRoles` trait is commented out, potentially causing authorization bypass.

**Impact:** Authorization failures leading to privilege escalation.

**Recommendation:** Implement proper role checking or remove the calls.

### 6. Session Fingerprinting Not Implemented
**File:** `/config/session.php:211`  
**CVSS Score:** 7.0 (High)  
**Severity:** High

Session fingerprinting is configured but not implemented, allowing session hijacking.

**Impact:** Session fixation and hijacking attacks.

**Recommendation:** Implement session fingerprinting middleware.

## üîß Medium Priority Issues (CVSS Score 4.0-6.9)

### 7. Rate Limiting Configuration Gap
**CVSS Score:** 6.8 (Medium)  
The health endpoints have rate limiting (30 requests/minute) but some sensitive endpoints may need stricter limits.

### 8. Password Reset Token Exposure
**CVSS Score:** 6.5 (Medium)  
Password reset functionality is not fully implemented but referenced in auth config.

### 9. Social Auth Security Gaps
**CVSS Score:** 6.2 (Medium)  
Social authentication fields exist but implementation details are not secured.

### 10. LGPD Consent Logging
**CVSS Score:** 5.8 (Medium)  
LGPD consent is logged but audit trail could be improved.

### 11. API Response Information Disclosure
**CVSS Score:** 5.5 (Medium)  
Some API responses include detailed error information that could aid attackers.

### 12. Token Expiration Configuration
**CVSS Score:** 4.8 (Medium)  
Sanctum token expiration is set to null, allowing indefinite token lifetime.
