### 4. Old Code Removal: ✅ VERIFIED

**No duplications found:**
- Old `/app/(dashboard)/admin/health-risks` removed
- Single implementation in `/app/(admin)/health-risks`
- No conflicting routes or services

## 🎯 Technical Excellence Implementation

### Code Quality Improvements Made:

1. **TypeScript Enhancements**

   - Implemented proper interfaces for complex objects

2. **React Best Practices**
   - Added `useCallback` for all async functions
   - Fixed dependency arrays in `useEffect`
   - Removed unused imports and variables

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks in all async operations
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing data

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - 5-15 minute cache TTLs
   - Lazy loading for heavy components
   - Pagination for large datasets
