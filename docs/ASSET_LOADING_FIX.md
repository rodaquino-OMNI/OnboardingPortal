# Frontend Asset Loading Fix

## Issue
Browser showing 404 errors for CSS and JS files:
- layout.css
- layout.js  
- main-app.js
- app-pages-internals.js

## Root Cause
Browser cache mismatch with Next.js development server versioning.

## Solution

### 1. Clear Browser Cache (Immediate Fix)
**In your browser:**
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Right-click the Refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

Or use keyboard shortcuts:
- Chrome/Edge: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Safari: `Cmd+Option+R`
- Firefox: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+F5` (Windows)

### 2. Verify Assets Are Loading
The assets ARE being served correctly:
```
✅ CSS: http://localhost:3000/_next/static/css/app/layout.css - Returns 200 OK
✅ Next.js: Running in development mode
✅ Static files: Being generated and served
```

### 3. Alternative Access Methods

#### Option A: Incognito/Private Window
Open the application in an incognito/private window:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

#### Option B: Different Browser
Try accessing with a different browser that hasn't cached old assets.

#### Option C: Add Cache Buster
Access with a query parameter:
```
http://localhost:3000/?v=new
```

### 4. Verify Current Status
Run this command to confirm assets are being served:
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/_next/static/css/app/layout.css
```

Expected response: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

## Current System Status
- ✅ Frontend container: Running
- ✅ Next.js dev server: Active
- ✅ Static assets: Being served (confirmed via curl)
- ✅ Port 3000: Accessible

## Login After Fixing Cache
Once cache is cleared, use these credentials:
```json
{
  "email": "admin@omnihealth.com",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}
```

The 404 errors are browser-side caching issues, not server problems. The application is functioning correctly.
