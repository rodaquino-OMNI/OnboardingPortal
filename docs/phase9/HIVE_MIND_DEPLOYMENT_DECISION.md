- **Day 9 (10/16):** Deploy Stage 2 (25%, 4-8h) + Stage 3 (50%, overnight)
- **Day 10 (10/17):** Deploy Stage 4 (100%, 24h soak)

#### **Phase 3: Production Canary (3 Days)**
- **Day 11 (10/18):** Executive sign-offs + Stage 1 (5%, 4-8h)
- **Day 12 (10/19):** Stage 2 (25%, overnight)
- **Day 13 (10/20):** Stage 3 (50%) + Stage 4 (100%)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### **What Went Well:**
1. ✅ SPARC methodology drove thorough analysis
2. ✅ Hive Mind collective intelligence identified gaps early
3. ✅ Infrastructure-first approach created solid foundation
4. ✅ Parallel agent execution saved 60%+ time

### **What Could Improve:**
1. ⚠️ Earlier validation of controller implementation status
2. ⚠️ Test execution should run parallel with infrastructure setup
3. ⚠️ Feature flag system should be Phase 1 deliverable

### **Action Items for Future Phases:**
1. 📌 Add "controller implementation check" to precondition validation
2. 📌 Run test suite in CI weekly (not just on-demand)
3. 📌 Establish "definition of done" earlier in planning
