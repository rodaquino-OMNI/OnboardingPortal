2. **Metric Monitors** (real-time)
   - Error rate threshold breach
   - Latency threshold breach
   - Database load threshold breach
   - Queue lag threshold breach

3. **Security Monitors** (real-time)
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Data corruption detection
   - Encryption failure detection
   - Token compromise alerts

### Rollback Triggers

**Hard Stop (Immediate Rollback)**:
- Error rate ≥ 5% for 2 minutes
- p95 latency ≥ 1000ms for 2 minutes
- Any security incident (any severity)
- Data corruption detected
- Encryption service failure
- Database unavailable > 1 minute

**Soft Stop (Investigation Required)**:

### Rollback Procedure

**Automated Rollback (Hard Stop)**:
```bash
# Executed by monitoring system
1. ALERT → PagerDuty (on-call team)
2. DECISION → Auto-rollback triggered (< 1 min)
3. EXECUTION → Feature flag toggle (< 30s)
   - Set sliceB_documents=false for all users
4. VERIFICATION → SLOs return to baseline (< 5 min)
5. NOTIFICATION → All stakeholders notified
```

**Manual Rollback (Soft Stop)**:
```bash
# Executed by on-call engineer
1. ALERT → PagerDuty (on-call team)
2. INVESTIGATION → Incident triage (< 5 min)
3. DECISION → Manual rollback approved
4. EXECUTION → Feature flag toggle
5. VERIFICATION → SLOs monitored
6. POST-MORTEM → Scheduled within 24h
```

**Target Rollback Time**: < 5 minutes (automated)
**Maximum Downtime**: < 1 minute (during rollback)

### Post-Rollback Actions

1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour):
   - Verify all users on stable version
   - Confirm SLOs returned to baseline
   - Document incident timeline
   - Preserve logs and metrics

2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours):
   - Root cause analysis
