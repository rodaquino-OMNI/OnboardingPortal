# ✅ Infinite Reload Loop Resolution - COMPLETE

## Issue Summary
The application was experiencing an infinite reload loop at http://localhost:3000/home due to multiple interconnected authentication and configuration issues.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Nginx Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: Nginx config referenced non-existent `frontend` upstream and wrong backend container name
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed frontend proxy references from HTTPS server block
  - Fixed upstream to use correct backend container name `austa_backend`
  - Fixed main location blocks to properly serve PHP files

### 2. ✅ Authentication Cookie Configuration
- **Problem**: Backend was setting cookies with domain restrictions that prevented frontend from reading them
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed domain restriction from cookie settings in AuthController.php
  - Set secure flag to false for localhost development
  - Used 'Lax' SameSite policy for better compatibility

### 3. ✅ API URL Configuration for Docker
- **Problem**: Frontend was trying to reach backend at localhost:8000 from inside Docker container
- **Fix**: 
  - Created api-config.ts to handle different URLs for server-side vs client-side
  - Server-side uses internal Docker network
  - Client-side uses public URL

### 4. ✅ Middleware Variable Typo
- **Problem**: middleware.ts referenced undefined `authCookie` instead of `authToken`
- **Fix**: Changed variable reference to correct `authToken`

### 5. ✅ Backend Environment Issues
- **Problem**: Database password not being passed, missing APP_KEY
- **Fix**: 
  - Added DB_PASSWORD to backend .env file
  - Generated new APP_KEY with `php artisan key:generate`
  - Cleared and rebuilt configuration cache

## Current Working State

### Services Running
- ✅ MySQL (port 3306)
- ✅ Redis (port 6379)
- ✅ Backend (PHP-FPM on port 9000)
- ✅ Nginx (port 8000 for HTTP, 8443 for HTTPS)
- ✅ Frontend (port 3000)

### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses http://localhost:3000/home
2. Middleware checks for auth_token cookie
3. If not authenticated, redirects to /login (single redirect, no loop)
4. Login page loads successfully (HTTP 200)
5. No infinite redirect loop occurs

## Test Results

### Redirect Test
```bash
curl -I -L --max-redirs 5 http://localhost:3000/home
```
**Result**: Single redirect to /login, then HTTP 200 OK

### Page Load Test
```bash
curl -s -L http://localhost:3000/home | grep "<title>"
```
**Result**: Shows "Login | Portal de Onboarding" - correct login page

### API Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
**Result**: `{"status":"healthy","service":"nginx","timestamp":"2025-08-19T22:09:30+00:00"}`

## Files Modified

1. `/omni-portal/docker/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
   - Fixed upstream definition
   - Removed frontend proxy references
   - Fixed location blocks

2. `/omni-portal/frontend/middleware.ts`
   - Fixed variable typo (authCookie → authToken)

3. `/omni-portal/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/AuthController.php`
   - Removed cookie domain restriction
   - Set secure flag to false for localhost

4. `/omni-portal/frontend/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
   - Removed redundant redirect logic

5. `/omni-portal/frontend/lib/api-config.ts`
   - Created to handle Docker networking

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. Access http://localhost:3000/home
2. Should redirect once to /login
3. Login page should load without further redirects
4. Check browser DevTools Network tab - no repeated redirects
5. Check browser Console - no infinite loop errors

## Success Metrics Achieved

✅ No infinite redirect loops
✅ Single, clean redirect from protected routes to login
✅ All services running and healthy
✅ Proper authentication flow
✅ No 502 Bad Gateway errors
✅ Frontend and backend properly connected

## Conclusion

The infinite reload loop issue has been successfully resolved through systematic identification and correction of multiple interconnected issues. The application now properly handles authentication redirects without creating loops.
