## Risk Assessment

### Residual Risks

#### Low Risk
- **UI Purity Violations**: Some components may have impure patterns
  - **Mitigation**: Non-blocking; can be addressed in Slice B
  - **Impact**: Low (isolated to specific components)

- **Performance Optimization**: Some endpoints may need tuning
  - **Mitigation**: Monitoring in place; can optimize post-deployment
  - **Impact**: Low (within acceptable thresholds)

#### Medium Risk
- **Analytics Dashboard Load**: High user load on analytics features
  - **Mitigation**: Canary deployment strategy with traffic controls
  - **Impact**: Medium (isolated to analytics features)

- **Third-party Dependencies**: External service reliability
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback mechanisms and circuit breakers in place
  - **Impact**: Medium (graceful degradation implemented)

#### High Risk
- **None Identified**: All high-risk items have been mitigated

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
1. **Canary Deployment**: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% rollout
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
3. **Automated Rollback**: Trigger on error rate >1%
