## Estimated Timeline for Slice B Completion

### High-Level Phases

**Total Estimated Effort**: 160-240 hours (4-6 weeks with team of 4-6 engineers)

---

### Phase 1: Foundation & Planning (Week 1) - 40 hours

**Activities**:
- Finalize Slice B route specifications
- Update OpenAPI spec with all 18 new routes
- Design database schema changes (if any)
- Create detailed task breakdown for each route
- Assign routes to engineers

**Deliverables**:
- OpenAPI spec updated (Version 1.1.0)
- Database migrations planned (if schema changes needed)
- JIRA/Linear tickets created for all 18 routes
- Team capacity confirmed and sprint planned

**Prerequisites**:
- Phase 8.1 validation complete ✅
- All P0 blockers resolved ✅
- Executive sign-offs obtained ✅

---

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation (Weeks 2-3) - 80 hours

**Activities**:
- Implement 18 API endpoints with controllers + services
- Apply encryption pattern to any new PHI/PII fields
- Integrate `AnalyticsEventRepository` for all new events
- Write PHPUnit tests for all new endpoints (target: 70% coverage)
- Update `routes/api.php` with new routes

**Deliverables**:
- 18 new controllers/endpoints (avg 4-5 hours each)
- PHPUnit tests (1 test file per controller)
- Analytics events defined for user actions
- OpenAPI spec implementation complete

**Key Patterns to Reuse**:
- `EncryptsAttributes` trait for sensitive fields
- `AnalyticsEventRepository` for event tracking
- `AuditLogService` for WHO-WHAT-WHEN-WHERE-HOW tracking
- Repository pattern for data access

**Risk**: Schema changes may require database migrations (add 8 hours if needed)

---

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Weeks 2-3) - 60 hours

**Activities** (parallel with Phase 2):
- Build React components for new pages (profile, document management, etc.)
- Implement form validation + error handling
- Add analytics event tracking to user interactions
- Write Jest + React Testing Library tests (target: 85% coverage)
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all new components

**Deliverables**:
- 10-12 new React components/pages
- Jest tests for all new components
- Integration with backend API endpoints
- Accessibility compliance validated

**Key Patterns to Reuse**:
- Existing form components (`/components/forms/`)
- API client hooks (`/hooks/useApi.ts`)
- Authentication context (`/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Error boundary pattern (`/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)

**Risk**: Complex state management for multi-step forms (profile update) may require additional time

---

### Phase 4: E2E & Integration Testing (Week 4) - 40 hours

**Activities**:
- Write Playwright E2E tests for all 18 new routes
- Extend accessibility tests to cover new pages
- Integration testing between frontend and backend

- Performance testing for new endpoints

**Deliverables**:
- Playwright test suite extended (18 new scenarios)
- Accessibility tests for new pages (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Integration test suite complete
- Performance benchmarks documented

**Key Patterns to Reuse**:
- Playwright configuration (`.playwrightrc.ts`)
- E2E CI workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e-phase8.yml`)
- Accessibility testing tooling (axe-core + Pa11y)

**Risk**: Flake rate >5% may require test stabilization (add 8 hours)

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Release (Week 5-6) - 20 hours

**Activities**:
- Update API documentation (OpenAPI spec complete)
- Write user-facing documentation (help articles)
- Create release notes for Slice B

- Release notes (CHANGELOG.md updated)
- Decision Journal entries (3-5 new entries)

**Key Patterns to Reuse**:
- OpenAPI spec structure
- Decision Journal template
- CHANGELOG format

---

### Phase 6: Staging Canary & Validation (Week 6) - 20 hours

**Activities**:
- Deploy Slice B to staging environment
- Run smoke tests + full E2E suite
- Monitor SLOs for 48 hours
- Gradual canary rollout (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- Rollback rehearsal

**Deliverables**:
- Staging deployment successful
- SLOs met for 48 hours
