**Branch**: phase8/gate-ab-validation
**Operator**: Hive Mind Queen (Strategic Coordinator)

## Working Tree Hygiene Assessment

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Working Tree NOT CLEAN

**Status**: FAILED - AUTO-HALT TRIGGERED

**Findings**:
- 1,127+ staged deletions detected (D prefix in git status)
- Multiple modified files (M prefix):
  - .github/workflows/security-guards.yml
  - .github/workflows/test-security-guards.sh
  - .gitignore
  - apps/web/jest.config.js
  - apps/web/next.config.js
  - apps/web/package.json
  - apps/web/playwright.config.ts
  - omni-portal/backend/app/Console/Kernel.php
  - omni-portal/backend/composer.json
  - omni-portal/backend/composer.lock
  - omni-portal/backend/config/database.php
  - omni-portal/backend/config/logging.php
  - And many more...
- 1 staged addition: docs/phase6/GATE5_ANALYTICS_EVIDENCE.md

## Required Action (Per §2 Working-Tree Hygiene)

**The mission explicitly states:**
> "Ensure the working tree is clean. Commit local changes or stash them if mid-work."

**Decision Required**:

### Option A: Commit All Changes (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(phase8): Complete staged deletions and modifications for mirror sync

- Remove 1,127+ deprecated files
- Update configuration files for Phase 8
- Add Gate 5 analytics evidence
- Prepare repository for GitHub mirror synchronization

This commit satisfies §2 working-tree hygiene requirements."
```

### Option B: Stash Changes (If Mid-Work)
```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: Phase 8 changes - pre-mirror-sync"
```

## Non-Negotiable Requirements Before Proceeding

Per mission §0 and §2:
1. ✅ Working tree MUST be clean (0 modified, 0 deleted, 0 added files)
2. ✅ Do NOT switch branches (mirror acts on refs)
3. ✅ Commit or stash is required before ANY mirror operations

## Next Steps After Tree Cleanup

1. Re-run `git status --porcelain` to verify clean tree
2. Update this document with PASS status
3. Proceed to §3 Scope Declaration
4. Continue with §4-12 of the mirror synchronization plan

## Auto-Halt Status

**HALT REASON**: Missing clean working tree (§2 requirement + §0 auto-halt condition)
**RESOLUTION**: Commit or stash all changes
**APPROVAL TO PROCEED**: Requires clean `git status` output

---

**NOTE**: This halt is a safety measure. The 1,127+ deletions are pre-approved for the mirror, but they must be committed to the local repository first to establish the authoritative source-of-truth state that will be mirrored to GitHub.
