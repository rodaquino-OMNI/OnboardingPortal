## Working Tree State Analysis

### Total File Changes: 1,602 files

**Breakdown:**
- **Deletions (D):** Majority of files (legacy cleanup)
- **Modifications (M):** ~50+ files (workflow updates, configs)
- **Additions (A):** 1 file (`docs/phase6/GATE5_ANALYTICS_EVIDENCE.md`)

### Top Deleted Paths (Sample from status output):

1. **Docs_For_development/** - Complete directory removal
   - ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ARCHITECTURE.md
   - AWS_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
   - Technical specifications and planning docs

2. **docker/** - Infrastructure cleanup
   - docker-compose.yml
   - docker/mysql/*, docker/nginx/*, docker/php/*
   - Observability stack (Grafana, Prometheus)

3. **omni-portal/backend/** - Laravel backend removal
   - Complete backend application structure
   - Controllers, Models, Services, Migrations
   - Tests, configuration, Docker files

4. **docs/** (partial) - Documentation consolidation
   - ADMIN_SYSTEM_*_REPORT_100_PERCENT.md
   - ADR_VIOLATIONS_MATRIX.md
   - Architecture analysis documents

5. **config/** - Configuration cleanup
   - mcp-isolation-config.json
   - system-diagnostic-config.json

### Key Preserved Files:

- ✅ `.github/workflows/` (modified, not deleted)
- ✅ `apps/web/` (Next.js app - modified configs)
- ✅ `docs/DECISION_JOURNAL.md` (modified)
- ✅ `docs/phase6/GATE5_ANALYTICS_EVIDENCE.md` (newly added)

### Deletion Verification: **APPROVED**

**Rationale:**
- Based on git history, these deletions represent intentional cleanup of:
  1. Legacy documentation superseded by new ADR system
  2. Docker infrastructure no longer needed
  3. Laravel backend replaced by Next.js/TypeScript stack
  4. Outdated configuration files

**Risk Assessment:** ✅ LOW - All deletions align with architectural modernization

---

## Default Branch Decision

### Current State:
- **Remote default:** `main` (via `origin/HEAD -> origin/main`)
- **Current branch:** `phase8/gate-ab-validation`
- **Proposed new default:** TBD based on encryption status

### Analysis:

**Option 1: Direct Mirror to `main` (NOT RECOMMENDED YET)**
- ❌ **Blocker:** ADR-004 encryption verification incomplete
- ❌ **Risk:** Potential unencrypted sensitive data in history
- ⏳ **Status:** PENDING encryption sweep completion

**Option 2: Quarantine Path (RECOMMENDED)**
- ✅ **Safe:** Isolates changes until encryption verified
- ✅ **Reversible:** Can promote to `main` after validation
- ✅ **Traceable:** Clear audit trail with timestamp
- ✅ **Compliant:** Aligns with Section 3 (Preparation) protocol

### Recommendation: **QUARANTINE PATH**

**Target quarantine branch:** `sot-20251006-quarantine`

**Rationale:**
1. Encryption status unknown (ADR-004 fix pending)
2. Large-scale deletions require validation window
3. Preserves ability to rollback if issues found
4. Allows parallel validation while maintaining `main` stability

---

## Mirror Commands (PREPARED, NOT EXECUTED)

⚠️ **DO NOT EXECUTE UNTIL:**
1. ✅ ADR-004 encryption verification complete
2. ✅ Stakeholder approval received
3. ✅ Backup snapshots confirmed

### Phase 1: Safety Snapshot (Execute First)

```bash
# Create timestamped archive of current state
git push origin phase8/gate-ab-validation:archive/pre-sync-20251006-151226

# Verify snapshot created
git ls-remote origin refs/heads/archive/pre-sync-20251006-151226
```

### Phase 2A: Quarantine Mirror (RECOMMENDED - Execute after Phase 1)

```bash
# Push to quarantine branch for validation
git push --force-with-lease origin phase8/gate-ab-validation:sot-20251006-quarantine

# Verify quarantine branch
git ls-remote origin refs/heads/sot-20251006-quarantine

# Update remote HEAD to point to quarantine (OPTIONAL - coordinate with team)
# git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/sot-20251006-quarantine
```

### Phase 2B: Direct Mirror to Main (ONLY AFTER ENCRYPTION VERIFIED)

```bash
# ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE - Only execute after all validations pass
git push --force-with-lease origin phase8/gate-ab-validation:main

# Verify main updated
git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main

# Update remote HEAD (if needed)
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
```

### Phase 3: Tag Mirror (No tags in scope)

```bash
# No tags to mirror (none created in last 10 days)
# If tags are created later:
# git push --force-with-lease origin <tag-name>
```

---

## Exclusions

### Branches NOT in 10-Day Window (Archive or Skip):

| Branch | Last Update | Action | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| main | 2025-09-02 | PRESERVE | Remote default branch |
| backup-before-restore-20250906-142713 | 2025-09-02 | PRESERVE | Safety backup |
| backup-before-ui-revert-20250901-181253 | 2025-08-28 | PRESERVE | Safety backup |

**Recommendation:** Preserve all backup branches indefinitely for audit trail.

### Remote-Only Branches to Delete:

**NONE** - All remote branches have local counterparts and serve valid purposes.

---

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items:
1. ⚠️ **1,602 file changes** - Large surface area for unintended consequences
2. ⚠️ **Encryption verification pending** - Blocker for direct-to-main mirror
3. ⚠️ **Force-push required** - Cannot use standard push (2 commits divergence)

### Mitigation Strategy:
1. ✅ **Phase 1 snapshot** - Ensures rollback capability
2. ✅ **Quarantine path** - Isolates changes for validation
3. ✅ **Force-with-lease** - Prevents overwriting unexpected remote changes
4. ✅ **Stakeholder approval** - Human validation before execution

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Analyst):
1. ✅ **Store scope summary in memory**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory store \
     --key "swarm/analyst/10day-scope" \
     --value "2 commits, 0 tags, 1602 files, quarantine recommended"
   ```

2. ✅ **Notify swarm of findings**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify \
     --message "Mirror scope analysis complete: 2 commits in-scope, quarantine path recommended pending ADR-004"
   ```

3. ✅ **Complete task coordination**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "task-1759794984554-b0ze49m0w"
   ```

### Blocked Items (Waiting on Other Agents):
- ⏳ **ADR-004 Encryption Verification** (Security Agent)
- ⏳ **Stakeholder Approval** (Team Lead)
- ⏳ **Backup Confirmation** (DevOps)

### Ready to Execute (After Blocks Cleared):
1. Run Phase 1 (Safety Snapshot)
2. Run Phase 2A (Quarantine Mirror)
3. Validate quarantine branch
4. If validated → Run Phase 2B (Promote to main)

---

## Appendix: Command Reference

### Verification Commands (Safe to Run Anytime):

```bash
# Check remote state
git ls-remote origin

# Verify local branch status
git status --short | wc -l

# Compare with origin/main
git log origin/main..phase8/gate-ab-validation --oneline

# Check for untracked files
git status --short | grep '^??'

# Verify no uncommitted changes
git diff --quiet && echo "Clean" || echo "Uncommitted changes!"
```

### Rollback Commands (Emergency Use):

```bash
# If mirror fails, restore from snapshot
git fetch origin archive/pre-sync-20251006-151226
git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD

# If main was corrupted
git push --force-with-lease origin archive/pre-sync-20251006-151226:main
```
