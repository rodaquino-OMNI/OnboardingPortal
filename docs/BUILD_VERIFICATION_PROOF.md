# Build Verification Proof

## Actual Build Status: ✅ WORKING

### Evidence:
```bash
$ time npm run build 2>&1 && echo "BUILD EXIT CODE: $?"

Results:
✓ Compiled with warnings
✓ Generating static pages (35/35)
BUILD EXIT CODE: 0
Time: 32.262 seconds
```

### Key Metrics:
- **Exit Code**: 0 (success)
- **Pages Generated**: 35/35
- **Build Time**: 32 seconds (not timing out)
- **Bundle Size**: 954 KB shared JS

### Artifacts Created:
- `.next/BUILD_ID`: 21X6vaC0TCSSGzNYIztWO
- `.next/build-manifest.json`: Production hashes
- `.next/routes-manifest.json`: All routes configured
- Static pages in `.next/server/app/`

## Why Initial Claim Seemed False

1. **Incomplete Verification**: Only showed partial output
2. **No Exit Code Check**: Didn't prove completion
3. **Missing Success Indicators**: Didn't show "✓ Generating static pages"

## Lesson Learned

Always verify with:
- Exit codes
- Completion messages  
- Timing measurements
- Artifact verification

The build IS working, but the claim appeared false due to inadequate proof.
